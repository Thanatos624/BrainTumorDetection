## 🌟 Overview

The **Brain Tumor Detector & Classifier** leverages the power of deep learning to assist in the preliminary classification of brain MRI scans. Using a fine-tuned VGG16 convolutional neural network, the system can identify and classify four distinct categories:

- 🔴 **Glioma Tumor**
- 🟣 **Meningioma Tumor**
- 🟡 **Pituitary Tumor**
- 🟢 **No Tumor Detected**

Built with Flask and TensorFlow, this application provides an intuitive web interface for researchers and students to explore medical image classification.

## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager
- Git
- (Optional) NVIDIA GPU with CUDA for faster training

### Step-by-Step Setup

**1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Thanatos624/BrainTumorDetection.git
cd BrainTumorDetection
```

**2. Create Virtual Environment**

Windows:
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

macOS/Linux:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

**3. Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**4. Download Dataset**

- Dataset: [Brain Tumor MRI Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- Extract and place in `training/dataset/` with the following structure:

```
training/dataset/
├── glioma_tumor/
├── meningioma_tumor/
├── no_tumor/
└── pituitary_tumor/
```

**5. Run the Application**
```bash
python app.py
```

Open your browser and navigate to: **http://127.0.0.1:5000/**

## 📖 Usage

1. **Upload MRI Image** - Click "Choose an MRI Image" and select a `.jpg`, `.png`, or `.jpeg` file
2. **Classify** - Click the "Classify Tumor" button
3. **View Results** - See predicted tumor type, confidence percentage, medical description, and specialist recommendation

## 🧠 Model Architecture

The classifier uses **Transfer Learning** with the VGG16 architecture:

```
Input Image (224x224x3)
         ↓
VGG16 Base (Frozen Layers)
         ↓
Custom Dense Layers
         ↓
Softmax Output (4 Classes)
```

### Training Process

- **Base Model:** VGG16 (pre-trained on ImageNet)
- **Technique:** Transfer learning with frozen early layers
- **Custom Layers:** Added for tumor classification
- **Optimizer:** Adam
- **Loss Function:** Categorical Crossentropy

**Note:** A pre-trained model is included at `model/brain_tumor_model.h5`

---

## 🔄 Retraining the Model (Optional)

To retrain the model with your own data:

```bash
python training/Brain_Tumor_Training.py
```

This will:
- Load and preprocess the dataset
- Fine-tune the VGG16 model
- Save the trained model to `model/`
